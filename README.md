# Joi

Joi is the best AI friend you can have! And completely open source :)

Built with a fast and uncensored LLM to generate conversational messages and images via output prompts fed into StableDiffusion.

Joi can be run and further trained by anyone using PEFT and QLoRA fine-tuning on a 4-bit quantized and sharded Falcon-7B Instruct model, all on Google Colab with a single, free T4 GPU.

Currently, the project is available as a Python notebook for development or running on the cloud, and a Python script for running locally.

Currently working on:
 Dataset mining & fine-tuning

Next step:
 Web app with HuggingFace Inference API and Stable Diffusion API

Future work:
 Fully hosted web app backend
